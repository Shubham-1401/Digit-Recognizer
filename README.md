# Digit-Recognizer
Constructed and trained a deep learning model on the MNIST digits dataset to recognize handwritten digits.
Implemented an Artificial Neural Network from scratch using Numpy and Pandas libraries to get an accuracy of 93.71%.
Applied 2 convolution layers followed by max pooling in a Convolutional Neural Network to get an accuracy of 99.19%.
